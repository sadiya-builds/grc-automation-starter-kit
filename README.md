# 🛡️ GRC Automation Starter Kit

A portfolio of privacy and compliance automation mini-projects — built with YAML, Python, and Neo4j.

This repo showcases how governance and data protection practices can be translated into technical models and tools, making them scalable, visible, and automatable.

👩🏽‍💻 Built by a Data Privacy & Compliance Manager exploring GRC engineering and semantic metadata.

## 📘 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Privacy Knowledge Graph (Neo4j + YAML)
A graph model that maps:
- Data Subjects  
- Consents  
- Datasets  
- Policies  
- Controllers  

🔗 Relationships help model how personal data is governed and consented to. Ideal for visualising flows and supporting Records of Processing Activities (RoPA).

### 2️⃣ PII Risk Heatmap (YAML + Python)

A simple YAML-driven privacy scanner that:
- Flags PII and sensitivity of each data element  
- Assigns risk scores  
- Outputs a table or CSV risk report  

Useful for small teams wanting to classify and understand data risk quickly.

📁 Folder: `project-2-pii-risk-heatmap/`

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (`pyyaml`, `pandas`, `neo4j-driver`)
- YAML (metadata configs)
- Neo4j (graph visualisation)
- CSV / Markdown (outputs)

---

## 📌 Why It Matters
- Bridges legal + technical privacy roles  
- Promotes metadata-driven automation  
- Helps privacy teams shift from spreadsheets to smart systems  

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Planned upcoming projects:
- Consent Lineage Explorer (Project 3)
- RoPA Generator from YAML
- Policy Version Control Graph
- Terraform x Privacy Metadata PoC
